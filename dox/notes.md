you want them or not."_

# Overview

Imagerrhea is a place to upload images, have them processed, and then
get served up. Sort of like Flickr, or Imagur, or CuteOverload or any
of a number of other image upload/sorting/sifting/showing services.

The idea is simple: you upload images, manipulate them, tag and group
them, then search, view and share them.

Some Examples:

* You upload a set of images. The system reads any tag data it can and
  saves the images unmodified along with the tags it has identified
  such as image size and any EXIF data embedded in the image. The
  system automatically creates a thumbnail view of the image for you
  to view in your dashboard. Later you can search your images by any
  identified tags or by upload date, etc.

* You select a group of images and mark them "blog". The system adds
  the "blog" tag to them, and resizes them to a size shareable on your
  blog, watermarks the shareable images with a watermark image of your
  choice, and creates a watermarked larger version of the image that
  people can click through to see.

* You upload a group of images taken from your cameraphone, and tag
  them with an event, such as "SF Vacation". The system pulls the
  geocoding information from your camera and tags the images with "San
  Francisco", "California", "USA", etc.

* You choose a group of images and say "share publically". People
  viewing your profile can then see the image thumbnails along with
  public links to them.

* You choose a group of images and say "share privately". Links to the
  images are created, but can only be seen by people you give the link
  to.
